# chaordic_admission_test

Simple product's suggestion list component in pure JS for the admission test at Chaordic.
Project's idea is to render a showcase of several items provided in a JSONP using pure JS, HTML and CSS.

The reference product should be rendered on the left side of the showcase.
The suggestions should be rendered on the right side, in a carousel like format, including behavior for scrolling items in that list.
